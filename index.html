      <h1>The Healing Power Of Music</h1>

      <p>
        It’s been called many things – the universal language, a great healer,
        even a reflection of the Divine. While there’s little doubt about the
        power of music, research now shows us just how powerful it can be.

      <p>
        It's almost impossible to find someone who doesn't feel a strong
        connection to music. Even if you can't carry a tune or play an
        instrument, you can probably reel off a list of songs that evoke happy
        memories and raise your spirits. Surgeons have long played their
        favorite music to relieve stress in the operating room, and extending
        music to patients has been linked to improved surgical outcomes. In the
        past few decades, music therapy has played an increasing role in all
        facets of healing.
